Abstract
---------

This project involves developing a full-stack web-application for creating and managing events. 
The aim is to provide an efficient, user-friendly platform that enables Eventmanagers to easily create events and offers customers the option to purchase tickets. 
The projectâ€™s primary focus, however, is on the implementation of the ticket purchasing process and related concurrency challenges. 
Particular attention is given to preventing collisions and handling errors as they arise.
